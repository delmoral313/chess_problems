# Chess Problems
Chess and Mathematics: the knight's tour (closed) and the eight queens problem solved. The respective solutions are displayed (animated) using the pygame package.
The knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.
The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Prerequisites
In order to test the code you need python3 with the numpy and pygame packages installed.
